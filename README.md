# jamipy

Jamipy is a little library of UI elements for [PyScript](https://pyscript.net) with [MicroPython](https://micropython.org) interpreter.

**mpy** all python files pre-compiled into bytecode for micropython
**jamipy.zip** all mpy files zipped for direct use in pyscript config as package

Made for personal use from not pro developer, so dont expect amazing code, as well some documentation in near future too.
